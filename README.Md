## Description

 I want to master the art of refactoring, or at least have a good idea of how it all works. Being able to read code and decipher whether something isn't right, and decide if making a small or large change is appropriate for every situation.
 I built on this project to get a better understanding of proper HTML and CSS structure. Understanding that working with someone else's code is typical in this field was the objective.
I solved a few issues in the Index.html dealing with syntax and proper structure. Changing tags from <div> to <section> and or <main> was the main issue with the code. The stylesheet was a bit long and unnecessary, so to fix that, i grouped a few classes together for a cleaner sheet. 
 I learned that refactoring can be a bit tedious. You have to pay attention to every little detail to get the code as clean as possible to make sure that the website meets accessibility requirements.
